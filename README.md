# Password Generator Starter Code

**Version 1.0.0**

## The Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a random password generator utilizing javascript functionality to manipulate the DOM based on criteria the viewer of the webpage requested through a series of browser displays. 

## Significant Changes
In terms of filtering out choices customer did not want I went with if/else statements covering all possible permutations of customer selection. I realize there is probably better ways to do it, and is not optimal given my limited purview only so many weeks into the course it was the best I could come up with. From each if/else statement confirm display value I would pull a character and randomize it in a loop that would push into an array until eventually I used the join method to return a string from the array.

### Challenges 
There were significant challenges on this project that were as much theoretical as practical. What I mean is the javascript code given to us was minimal and in terms of architecture there were a myriad of ways one could go about it. Further, the project utilized or necessitated javascript concepts I was not entirely familiar with. For example, some of the students in office hours used the for each method, others splicing, and myself String.fromCharCode which I found a helpgul video guide my thinking on that aspect. I think it was a project that stretched me and made me realize I presume I will have to do more out of the box thinking to make it through this course.
